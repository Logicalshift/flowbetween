 ** Cached drawings
 **
 ** For some transformations as well as for things like onion skins, it's too costly to calculate the drawing every
 ** time it needs to be made (rather than every time it changes). The drawing cache provides a serialised set of
 ** canvas draw instructions that can be used to render these items more quickly.
 **
 ** Cached items should never contain critical data, so it's always safe to delete from this table.
