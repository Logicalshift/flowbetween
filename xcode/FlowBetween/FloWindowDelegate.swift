        // Can't tie this to FlowBetween's code at all. Whenever windowWillClose is called, the window
        // is released, regardless of the strong reference stored by this class. It's then released
        // again when this class is freed due to that strong reference, causing a crash.
        //
        // If this class doesn't stop the session after windowWillClose (which means nothing other than
        // the Swift side is freeing windows) then the window is still freed up on close. This appears
        // to be down to Cocoa.
        //
        // This adds an extra retain to the window so that it's only freed once. Not sure why a similar
        // issue does not happen for the popup window. Rust side does manual reference counting but it
        // never finds out about the window directly and doesn't double-free anything else so there's
        // nowhere to add an extra retain on that side.
